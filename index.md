### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1, is one of my favorite labs because I think it is interesting how we can call data from a vector to organize and create a statement about a county's population. I was able to work on functions and create for loops that called specific parts from a vector. This lab was challenging but fun to overcome.

* Lab 9 

    Lab 9, part 2 is one of my favorite labs because I was able to create a pattern with inner for loops. Though the task sounded difficult, it only took three inner loops to create a cool looking pattern. I now know how to create patterns if I wanted to with inner loops.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 is one of my favorite labs because I was able to translate real life traffic signs and create a code that resembled them. I was able to use if functions to determine when a vehicle is able to part at a certain time and place. It is interesting to realize how real life situations can be represented in code.
